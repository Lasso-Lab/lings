# lings
Lings' ambition is to be a framework to easily build language agnostic and translatables coding exercises.

Lings takes inspiration from excellent ressources like [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and [ziglings](ziglings.org), but tries to make them more general.

The goal is to let people easily build little exercises in different programming languages to encourage the learning of progammation, and that even among people not familiar with english.
